- ‚úÖ Git push ‚Üí App automatically deploys
- ‚úÖ Database, SSL, domain - all included
- ‚úÖ Costs $0-5/month for testing (first $5 FREE)

## üìã Prerequisites:

1. GitHub account (if you don't have, create at github.com)
2. Your backend code (SamyakGyan_Backend folder)
3. Credit/debit card (for verification, won't be charged initially)
4. 30 minutes of time

---

## üéØ Step-by-Step Deployment (30 Minutes):

### PART 1: Push Code to GitHub (10 min)

#### Step 1.1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to github.com
2. Click "New Repository" (green button)
3. Name: `samyakgyan-backend`
4. Set to **Private** (important!)
5. Click "Create Repository"

#### Step 1.2: Push Your Code
Open terminal/command prompt:

```bash
# Navigate to your backend folder
cd c:\Users\danan\SamyakGyan_Backend

# Initialize git (if not already)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/samyakgyan-backend.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Done!** Your code is now on GitHub (private, only you can see).

### PART 2: Deploy to Railway (15 min)

#### Step 2.1: Sign Up for Railway
1. Go to railway.app
2. Click "Login" ‚Üí "Login with GitHub"

2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Find your `samyakgyan-backend` repo
4. Click it

**Railway will automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Detect it's a Node.js app
- ‚úÖ Run `npm install`
- ‚úÖ Start your app
- ‚úÖ Give you a URL like: `your-app.railway.app`

#### Step 2.3: Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In same project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Click "Add PostgreSQL"

**Railway automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Creates database
- ‚úÖ Gives you connection URL
- ‚úÖ Sets environment variables

#### Step 2.4: Configure Environment Variables
1. Click on your backend service
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add these:

```
DATABASE_URL = (automatically added by Railway)
PORT = 3000
NODE_ENV = production
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = (your telegram bot token - if you have)
```

Railway automatically connects your app to PostgreSQL!

#### Step 2.5: Run Database Migrations
1. Click on your backend service
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Deploy"
4. Under "Build Command", leave as: `npm install`

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/schema.sql
```

**Or** use a tool like TablePlus (free) to connect and run schema.sql

### PART 3: Get Your Domain (5 min)

#### Option A: Use Railway Subdomain (FREE)
Your app is already live at: `your-app.railway.app`

**Advantages:**
- Free
- HTTPS included
- Works immediately

**Disadvantages:**
- Not a custom domain
- URL is long

#### Option B: Buy Cheap Domain ($1-2/year)

**Recommended: Namecheap.com**
1. Go to namecheap.com
2. Search: `samyakgyan` or `sgupsc` or similar
3. Select `.xyz` or `.site` (cheapest, $1-2/year)
4. Buy it
5. In domain settings, add these DNS records:

```
Type: CNAME
Host: @
Value: your-app.railway.app
TTL: Automatic
```

6. In Railway:
   - Click your service
   - Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
   - Click "Custom Domain"
   - Enter your domain
   - Done!

**Wait 10 minutes - 2 hours for DNS to propagate**

## üéØ My Strong Recommendation:

### DO THIS TODAY:

1. **Deploy to Railway.app** (30 min)
   - Free for testing
   - Zero DevOps knowledge
   - Live immediately

2. **Buy cheap .xyz domain** (10 min)
   - $1-2 for a year
   - Point to Railway

3. **Test everything** (1-2 hours)
   - Multiple Telegram accounts
   - Real-world usage
   - Fix bugs

4. **When MilesWeb replies:**
   - You'll already have a deployed app
   - You'll understand your actual needs
   - You can make informed decision
   - Likely: You'll stick with Railway because it's SO much easier

## üÜò If You Need Help:

### Railway Support:
- Discord: railway.app/discord (very responsive)
- Docs: docs.railway.app
- Community: Very helpful

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** "Build failed"
**Solution:** Check logs, usually missing `package.json` or `start` script

**Issue:** "Database connection failed"
**Solution:** Use `DATABASE_URL` env variable Railway provides

**Issue:** "App crashes on start"
**Solution:** Check logs, usually port binding (use `process.env.PORT`)

---

## üì± Connect Frontend to Deployed Backend:

### Update Frontend URLs:

Create `scripts/config.js`:
```javascript
// config.js
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app.railway.app'; // Your Railway URL

// Replace in all files
// Before: 'http://localhost:3000'
// After: API_BASE_URL
```

Update all fetch calls:
```javascript
// Before
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users/login', ...)

// After
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/users/login`, ...)
```

---

## üéä Summary:

### Traditional VPS (MilesWeb):
- You: Server admin
- Requires: Linux, SSH, DevOps knowledge
- Time: Hours to deploy
- Stress: High

### Railway.app:
- You: Just a developer
- Requires: Git push
- Time: Minutes to deploy
- Stress: Zero

**For your use case (no DevOps knowledge, testing phase, monthly billing), Railway.app is 10x better.**
