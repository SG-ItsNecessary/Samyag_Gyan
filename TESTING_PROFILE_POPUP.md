# User Profile Popup - Testing Guide

## What We Implemented:

### 1. User Profile Popup
- Complete popup with all sections from approved design
- Fetches real data from backend APIs
- Blinking red "Inactive" subscription status
- Masked referral code (X*****Si pattern)
- Date formatting (DD-MMM-YYYY format)

### 2. UI Changes
- **Subscribe note moved** to bottom right corner as info text
- **"Your Trial Ends" button** now clickable â†’ shows profile popup
- **Topic buttons behavior:**
  - Active (transparent): Click â†’ shows profile popup
  - Inactive (RED): Click â†’ scroll and highlight (existing behavior)

### 3. Backend Integration
- Fetches from GET `/api/users/profile/:userId`
- Fetches from GET `/api/referrals/stats/:userId`
- Fetches from GET `/api/topics/my-subscriptions/:userId`
