          <span class="question" data-main_question_id="101" data-article_id="1" data-language="en">
            ✦ What is Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)?
          </span>

          <p class="answer" data-main_answer_id="201" data-main_question_id="101" data-article_id="1" data-language="en">
            DPI refers to foundational systems like Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker and more that create a base for scalable public digital services. These systems enable identity, payments, and document verification at scale. Together, they make service delivery faster, cheaper, and more inclusive. This public-facing technology stack is built on open standards, promoting a shared ecosystem for innovation.

          <span class="question" data-main_question_id="102" data-article_id="1" data-language="en">
            ✦ How is DPI transforming governance?
          </span>

          <p class="answer" data-main_answer_id="202" data-main_question_id="102" data-article_id="1" data-language="en">
            Government schemes use Aadhaar-based DBT to directly transfer benefits, avoiding middlemen and leakages. DigiLocker digitizes records like driving licenses and academic certificates. UPI allows anyone with a phone and bank account to send or receive payments instantly, without transaction fees. This direct transfer model has revolutionized welfare distribution, ensuring that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries efficiently.

          <span class="question" data-main_question_id="103" data-article_id="1" data-language="en">
            ✦ Why is India's model globally praised?
          </span>

          <p class="answer" data-main_answer_id="203" data-main_question_id="103" data-article_id="1" data-language="en">
            India's DPI stack is open, low-cost, scalable, and sovereign. It's being adapted by countries in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. The absence of corporate dependencies (like GAFA) makes it attractive for nations seeking self-reliance in digital governance. This approach provides a viable alternative to proprietary, corporate-driven models, which often come with high costs and data control issues.

          <span class="question" data-main_question_id="104" data-article_id="2" data-language="en">
            ✦ Why renewable energy for India?
          </span>

          <p class="answer" data-main_answer_id="204" data-main_question_id="104" data-article_id="2" data-language="en">
            India has rising energy needs, a large rural population, and global climate commitments. Renewable sources like solar and wind offer sustainable, decentralized alternatives to coal-based energy. Clean energy reduces pollution and dependency on imported oil. Shifting to renewables also enhances the country's energy security, protecting it from volatile international fuel markets.

            The National Solar Mission has scaled solar parks across states. New incentives encourage green hydrogen and battery storage. India aims to install 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030, supporting SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy). The government has implemented a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic manufacturing of solar PV modules and advanced chemistry cells.

          <p class="answer" data-main_answer_id="206" data-main_question_id="106" data-article_id="2" data-language="en">
            Energy storage tech is still evolving. Land acquisition delays big projects. Transmission infrastructure needs investment. The intermittent nature of solar and wind power requires sophisticated grid management and large-scale battery storage solutions. Social challenges include the potential for job displacement in the traditional coal industry and the need for reskilling the workforce.
