1. Go to: `C:\Users\danan\Frontend\`
2. **Double-click `start-server.bat`**
3. A black window opens showing server is running
4. **Keep this window open!** (Don't close it)

**Option B: Manual Command**

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\danan\Frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

---

### **STEP 3: Test on Your Computer FIRST**

Open browser on your computer and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000/articles.html
```

‚úÖ **Does it work?** ‚Üí Great! Server is running correctly

‚ùå **Doesn't work?** ‚Üí Server not started or wrong folder

---

### **STEP 4: Test with IP on Your Computer**

Still on your computer, open:
```
http://192.168.1.10:8000/articles.html
```

‚úÖ **Does it work?** ‚Üí Perfect! Firewall is configured correctly

‚ùå **Doesn't work but Step 3 worked?** ‚Üí Firewall is blocking ‚Üí Go back to Step 1

---

### **STEP 5: Test on Mobile**

1. **Make sure phone is on SAME WiFi** as your computer
2. Open browser on phone
3. Type this URL exactly:
```
http://192.168.1.10:8000/articles.html
```

‚úÖ **Works?** ‚Üí üéâ SUCCESS! You're done!

‚ùå **Doesn't work?** ‚Üí See troubleshooting below

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### ‚ùå Problem: Mobile shows "Can't reach this page" or "Connection refused"

**Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Server running? (black window is open)
2. ‚úÖ Step 3 works? (localhost on computer)
3. ‚úÖ Step 4 works? (IP on computer)
4. ‚úÖ Firewall configured? (Step 1 done correctly)
5. ‚úÖ Both on same WiFi? (not mobile data, not guest WiFi)
6. ‚úÖ Using `http://` not `https://`

**If Steps 3 & 4 work but mobile doesn't:**
‚Üí Your phone is not on the same WiFi network as computer

**If Step 3 works but Step 4 doesn't:**
‚Üí Firewall is still blocking ‚Üí Redo Step 1 carefully

---

### ‚ùå Problem: "This site can't be reached" instantly (no loading)

**Cause:** Not on same WiFi or wrong IP

**Fix:**
1. On computer, open Command Prompt
2. Run: `ipconfig`
3. Look for "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi"
4. Find "IPv4 Address"
5. Use that IP instead

Example:
```
If ipconfig shows: 192.168.0.105
Then use: http://192.168.0.105:8000/articles.html
```

---

### ‚ùå Problem: Page loads but looks broken (no styling)

**Cause:** Browser cache

**Fix:**
1. On mobile, press and hold the reload button
2. Select "Hard Refresh" or "Clear cache"
3. Or manually clear browser cache

---

### ‚ùå Problem: Works on computer but not mobile

**Possible causes:**

**1. Different WiFi Networks**
- Computer on WiFi 5GHz band
- Phone on WiFi 2.4GHz band
- Solution: Connect both to same band

**2. Router AP Isolation Enabled**
- Some routers block device-to-device communication
- Check router settings for "AP Isolation" or "Client Isolation"
- Disable it

**3. VPN Running**
- Disable VPN on computer or phone
- Test again

**4. Antivirus/Security Software**
- Temporarily disable antivirus
- Test mobile access
- If works ‚Üí Add exception for Python

---

### ‚ùå Problem: Server window closes immediately

**Cause:** Server crashed or wrong directory

**Fix:**
1. Open Command Prompt manually
2. Run:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\danan\Frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```
3. Look for error messages

---

## üåê ALTERNATIVE METHOD: Use ngrok (Works 100%)

If nothing else works, use ngrok to create a public URL:

### **Step 1: Download ngrok**

1. Go to: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Download Windows version
3. Extract to Desktop

### **Step 2: Start Local Server**

```cmd
cd C:\Users\danan\Frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

### **Step 3: Start ngrok**

Open NEW Command Prompt:
```cmd
C:\Users\danan\Desktop\ngrok.exe http 8000
```

### **Step 4: Get Public URL**

ngrok will show a URL like:
```
Forwarding: https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
```

### **Step 5: Open on Mobile**

On any device, anywhere in the world:
```
https://abc123.ngrok.io/articles.html
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works 100% of the time
- ‚úÖ No firewall issues
- ‚úÖ No WiFi issues
- ‚úÖ Can share with anyone

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå URL changes each time
- ‚ùå Free tier has limits
- ‚ùå Slower than local network

## üì± MOBILE TESTING PAGES

Once it works, test these pages:

```
http://192.168.1.10:8000/articles.html
http://192.168.1.10:8000/homepage.html
http://192.168.1.10:8000/ethics_essays_poll.html
http://192.168.1.10:8000/user_dashboard_testbed.html
```

## üí° PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Create QR Code**

1. Go to: https://www.qr-code-generator.com/
2. Enter: `http://192.168.1.10:8000/articles.html`
3. Download QR code
4. Scan with phone ‚Üí Opens directly!

### **Tip 2: Keep Server Running**

- Don't close the black server window
- Minimize it instead
- Server runs until you close the window

### **Tip 3: Refresh Changes**

- After editing code, refresh mobile browser
- No need to restart server (unless server-side changes)

### **Tip 4: Check WiFi Name**

On computer:
```cmd
netsh wlan show interfaces
```

Look for "SSID". Make sure phone is connected to same SSID.

## üìã FINAL CHECKLIST

Before asking for help, verify ALL of these:

- [ ] Python installed (run `python --version`)
- [ ] Server running (black window open)
- [ ] Firewall configured (Python allowed through firewall)
- [ ] Works on computer localhost (Step 3)
- [ ] Works on computer with IP (Step 4)
- [ ] Phone on same WiFi as computer
- [ ] WiFi is not guest network
- [ ] Using correct IP (run `ipconfig` to verify)
- [ ] Using port 8000
- [ ] Using `http://` not `https://`
- [ ] No VPN running

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

### **Working Configuration:**

**Server Window Shows:**
```
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
```

**Computer Browser (localhost):**
```
http://localhost:8000/articles.html ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
```

**Computer Browser (IP):**
```
http://192.168.1.10:8000/articles.html ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
```

**Mobile Browser:**
```
http://192.168.1.10:8000/articles.html ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works
```

---

## üÜò STILL NOT WORKING?

### **Last Resort: Test with Different Device**

1. Try accessing from another laptop/computer on same WiFi
2. If works ‚Üí Issue with phone WiFi settings
3. If doesn't work ‚Üí Issue with computer/server/firewall

### **Router Issues:**

Some routers have "AP Isolation" or "Client Isolation" that blocks device-to-device communication:

1. Log into router admin panel (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`)
2. Look for "AP Isolation", "Client Isolation", or "Station Isolation"
3. Disable it
4. Restart router
5. Test again

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ Server window stays open
- ‚úÖ localhost:8000 works on computer
- ‚úÖ 192.168.1.10:8000 works on computer
- ‚úÖ 192.168.1.10:8000 works on mobile
- ‚úÖ All features work (highlights, images, etc.)

**Follow these steps IN ORDER and test after each step. 99% of issues are firewall or WiFi network related!**

Good luck! üöÄ
