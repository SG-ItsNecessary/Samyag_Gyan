## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:

### Don't Do This:
❌ Build everything before deploying
❌ Add features friends didn't ask for
❌ Optimize for 10,000 users when you have 10
❌ Spend weeks on perfect design
❌ Launch without testing with real users

### Do This Instead:
✅ Deploy early, test often
✅ Build what users need
✅ Solve for current scale
✅ Ship "good enough" and iterate
✅ Test with friends before public launch
